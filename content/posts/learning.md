# Learning 090

On this course, and especially doing this small little project, I have learnt some good and practical ways of actually using DevOps mechanisms and techniques very easily!
Also on the video and questionnaire part I learned more about the ideas and the whole basis of it all, why to work in this way and what to think about it.
