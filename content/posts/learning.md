# Learning 090

On this course, and especially by doing this small little project, I have learnt some good and practical ways of actually using DevOps mechanisms and techniques very easily! I have used some techniques like this before but this refreshed my memory and I also learnt some new methods to do stuff. The course has been pretty easy, the questionnaires went pretty quick, and this more advanced project was not very hard either. I had a bit of a battle with setting up Hugo properly but that was only due to me not following the instructions properly, so in the end I redid it and all worked like a charm. To be honest I've always disliked these site builders like Hugo that involves setting up layouts and partial html files, it feels to always cause some headaches. But I got it working, and I guess next time will be easier again.

Also on the video and questionnaire part I learned more about the ideas and the whole basis of it all, why to work in this way and what to think about it. For me it's usually hard to remember any of the terminology about these kind of things, but I think I learned them now.

The questionnaires used on this and many other courses are often very annoying to deal with. I feel like often the topics are easy and very understandable, and then because the actual learning material is easy the questionnaires are built in a way that just trains your ability to read them super carefully to spot any traps in them.
