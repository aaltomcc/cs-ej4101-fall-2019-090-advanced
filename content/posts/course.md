# this course 090

I decided to enroll on this course in order to familiarize myself a bit more with DevOps and the actual fundamentals of it.
I have used some of the similar techniques before but I felt like there was more for me to learn about it. When I saw that the course also has some nice little project, I thought that it will be the perfect thing to actually get to know some proper ways of doing things. And now it works! Great!
Before I have been making some websites for friends and helping them to set up some projects, but I have always felt that the possible ways of doing it are many, and I have not actually used the best and most practical ones. Integrating more devops to my own projects will definitely help me in the future, and that is mostly why I decided to enroll on this course as well.
I often have trouble getting into some new ways of doing things, if I dont know for sure that it is going to help me a lot and not be too much work to get into. When I read the course description I realized this course to be the perfect boost to my learning in this way. I would learn just the things I should have learned already by my own, but I just have not had the time and energy to put into learning some of these new ways of working. I think this course will also remind me in the future that learning new skills for making my working "process" better and more efficient will be worth it.
