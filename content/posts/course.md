# this course 090

I decided to enroll on this course in order to familiarize myself a bit more with DevOps and the actual fundamentals of it.
I have used some of the similar techniques before but I felt like there was more for me to learn about it. When I saw that the course also has some nice little project, I thought that it will be the perfect thing to actually get to know some proper ways of doing things. And now it works! Great!
