## About me
Hello, this is the landing page. Here I tell about my fictional self. So here we go.

I'm a president of the Hugolandia. I rule ruthlessly, I add content as I please. My goal is to someday pass the Travis CI build, altho I think it might be impossible. The tokens are not on my side... I might need to make another post so that I could persuade the tokens to play with me. In hugoland we play with layouts, but more often the layouts play us, since we dont actually care so much about the looks of things.
