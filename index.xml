      <description>this course 090 I decided to enroll on this course in order to familiarize myself a bit more with DevOps and the actual fundamentals of it. I have used some of the similar techniques before but I felt like there was more for me to learn about it. When I saw that the course also has some nice little project, I thought that it will be the perfect thing to actually get to know some proper ways of doing things.</description>

      <description>Learning 090 On this course, and especially doing this small little project, I have learnt some good and practical ways of actually using DevOps mechanisms and techniques very easily! Also on the video and questionnaire part I learned more about the ideas and the whole basis of it all, why to work in this way and what to think about it.</description>
